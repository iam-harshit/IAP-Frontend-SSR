          <p>
            While Inspiration App allows a wide variety of products to be sold,

            reading through this list to ensure your account complies with our
            guidelines. In general, we do not allow reselling – you cannot sell
            products that you didn’t create. You may act as an affiliate for
            another Inspiration App creator, but you cannot sell products that
            were not created by you. We do not permit any activity or content
            that promotes or encourages discrimination based on race, sex,
            religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age. This
            applies to any content sent out via our email services or as part of
            any products sold on Inspiration App.

            Dealing with Violations of Our Terms
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you share, promote, or sell content that violates the guidelines
            listed above, it is a violation of our Terms of Service. Depending
            on the situation, we may suspend your account and refund your sales.
            However, if that is not the case, and we are able to pay you:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>
              If your product is found to violate our Terms, the product will be
              removed, but you will still be allowed to operate the account;
            </li>
            <li>
              On the second violation, you will be given a two-week notice, paid
              out for your remaining sales, and your account will be deleted.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This list is maintained separately from Inspiration App's Terms of
            Service. While we make every effort to keep this list current, it
            may change abruptly and without notice due to card network rules,
            legislation, and payment processor relationships. Changes to this
            list take effect immediately.
